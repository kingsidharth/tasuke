- All enviornment variables, secrets, API keys, etc. must be stored in .env file
- .env file must be included in .gitignore
- Create and maintain a sample.env file that has same keys as .env file but dummy values â€” this should be part of the git repo (not in .gitignore)
- ALWAYS UPDATE sample.env file whenever you're updating .env file. THIS IS CRITICAL
